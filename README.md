## Dinoflagellates have dual carbon roles and alter nutrient metabolism across environmental gradients in the central Pacific Ocean

In this study we explored the metabolism of unicellular eukaryotic organisms (protists) across a 4,600 km meridional transect in the central Pacific Ocean. The region contains a natural biogeochemical gradient spanning from low nitrogen, oligotrophic waters to a productive equatorial upwelling system. We used a combined geochemical and 'omic approach to characterize the metabolic strategies these organisms rely upon to adapt to changes in their chemical environment.

Input files are included.

(Note: The "blue" WGCNA color module was later changed to the black, and "turquoise" to white for clarity during visualizations.)
